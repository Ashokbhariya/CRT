Q: How do lists and tuples differ in terms of mutability and performance? When would you choose one over the other?
A: Lists are mutable (can be modified), while tuples are immutable (cannot be modified). 
    Lists are slower due to their dynamic nature, whereas tuples are faster and use less memory. 
    When the data is to be changeable we use lists but for unchangeable data we use tuples.
