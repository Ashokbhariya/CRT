Q: Explain how Python handles type conversion between different data types, such as between integers and floats or
    between strings and lists.
A: Python handles type conversion in two ways: implicit and explicit.

    Implicit conversion: Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed, like turning an integer into a float during calculations.
    Example: result = 5 + 3.2 â†’ result becomes 8.2 (int to float).

    Explicit conversion (type casting): You manually convert data using functions like int(), float(), str(), or list().
    Example: int("10") converts a string to an integer.
             list("hello") turns a string into a list of characters.
